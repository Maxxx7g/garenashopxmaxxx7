# TODO: Redesign Diamond Section with Professional Look

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update style.css: Apply glassmorphism effect to .topup-section with backdrop-filter blur, rgba backgrounds, smooth shadows, and rounded corners.
- [x] Update .diamond-grid div: Add premium styling with subtle backgrounds, increased border-radius, box-shadows, hover effects, red theme gradients for selected state, and minimalist typography.
- [x] Update .send-btn: Apply gradient red button with hover effects, consistent with login button.
- [x] Ensure responsive design: Adjust grid columns for smaller screens.
